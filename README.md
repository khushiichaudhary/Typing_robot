# Keyboard-Typing-Bot

**Voice-Controlled Mechanical Typing System**

## Overview

Keyboard-Typing-Bot is an innovative system designed to receive voice commands and utilize a mechanical arm for physical keystrokes on a keyboard. This system achieves an impressive 70% accuracy rate and operates with a swift 0.2-second response time between command reception and execution.

## Features

- **üó£Ô∏è Voice Command Recognition:** Powered by Python's natural language processing (NLP), enabling accurate interpretation of voice commands.
- **ü¶æ Mechanical Arm Typing:** Arduino-controlled robotic arm ensures precise and coordinated keystrokes using servo motors.
- **‚å®Ô∏è Physical Key Pressing:** Realizes human-like typing by physically pressing keys on the keyboard.
- **‚ö° Fast Response Time:** Executes commands swiftly within 0.2 seconds of receiving voice inputs.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** Utilized for NLP to process and interpret voice commands.
- **Arduino:** Controls the robotic arm, facilitating precise movements.
- **Servo Motors:** Provides mechanical power for keystrokes.
- **NLP Libraries:** Includes SpeechRecognition for voice command processing.
- **Hardware Components:** Arduino board, servo motors, and a mechanical arm.
